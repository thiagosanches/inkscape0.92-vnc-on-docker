# inskcape0.92-vnc-on-docker
Docker image that contains a specific version (0.92) of Inkscape where it's possible to use it through VNC. Unfortunatelly, on newer versions of Inkscape the `MI-GRBL-Z-AXIS-Servo-Controller` plugin doesn't work anymore. So, I had to create this image in order to have a way to generate the GCODEs properly.
