# inskcape0.92-vnc-on-docker
Docker image that contains a specific version (0.92) of Inkscape where it's possible to use it through VNC. 

Unfortunatelly, on newer versions of Inkscape the [MI-GRBL-Z-AXIS-Servo-Controller](https://github.com/ikae/MI-GRBL-Z-AXIS-Servo-Controller) plugin doesn't work properly (I believe that is something related to python3). So, I had to create this image in order to have a way to generate the GCODEs properly.
